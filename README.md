# Clock with alarm for device PicoPad Wi-Fi

- This is my example CircuitPython application for device PicoPad with Wi-Fi.
- The example shows the current time and date synchronized with NTP. 

- One alarm can be set. The alarm clock melody is the title theme 
- from Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda, composed by composer Kōji Kondō
- and stored in the melody.py file.

- **Usage:**

- First, install CircuitPython on your PicoPad from 
- https://circuitpython.org/board/pajenicko_picopad/

- After installing CircuitPython, copy the entire contents to 
- the flash memory of PicoPad named CIRCUITPY. (Do not use BOOTSEL!!!)
- For the NTP synchronization feature, you must edit the settings.toml file.
- Enter your Wi-Fi SSID and password.

- **Control by buttons:**

Up 	increase the alarm hour
Down 	decrease the alarm hour
Right 	increase the alarm minute
Left 	decrease the alarm minute
A 	Day mode | Green color
B 	Night mode | Red color
X 	Switching off the display
Y 	Maximize the brightness of the display.
